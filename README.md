# Web Diviner RI

To appreciate what the Histrion is, first, read the very first paper on DNAP over here: https://www.scribd.com/document/463360971/DNAP-JWL 

There is more recent literature about DNAP and the Histrion that that resource, however, it is much recommended to start with that paper.

## Some History...

Having finished work on the first implementation of DNAP's [Web Histrion](https://github.com/NuChwezi/dnap-web-histrion), it became necessary to work on the Web Diviner component of DNAP, so as to allow data analysis to be done natively on the DNAP ecosystem.

The Original DNAP Web Diviner is based off of a SPA hand-coded on CodePen some years ago: http://codepen.io/mcnemesis/pen/EgWEPg.

 From that work, was then adapted this project as the basis for the auto-analytics component of the futuristic data platform originally part of "Project Okot".

This project kicked off based on inspirations from [CSSFlow](http://www.cssflow.com), in particular, the analytics widget concept at:
